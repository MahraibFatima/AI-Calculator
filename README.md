# AI Calculator
Letâ€™s play around with a basic artificially intelligent calculator.

# Features
This is how the application works:

- It takes in inputs as text
- Translates them into mathematical notation
- Returns the answers in the numerical form

# Commands
Use the following keywords for their associated operations:

- plus for addition
- minus for subtraction
- times for multiplication
- divided by for division

# Sample input

What is two plus 24?
What is two plus 5 times 20
The AI calculator can get confused at times and may ask you to enter valid commands. Try to be specific in your commands. For example, use `one hundred twenty` instead of `hundred twenty` for 
`120`.

Sample output

```two plus 24 = 26```

```two plus 5 times 20 = 102```
